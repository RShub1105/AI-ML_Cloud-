# ☁️ Cloud Fundamentals – Day 1

## 🌤 What is Cloud Computing?
**Cloud computing** is the use of **remote servers (via the internet)** to store, manage, and process data instead of using local machines.

### 🚀 It Provides:
- ⚡ **On-Demand Access** – Use servers anytime, anywhere.  
- 💰 **Pay-as-you-go** – Pay only for what you use.  
- 📈 **Scalability** – Easily add or remove resources as needed.  
- 🔒 **Reliability** – Data is stored securely and backed up automatically.
